- 👋 Hi, I’m @jamesbuch
- 👀 I’m interested in compilers and interpreters, arm64 machine code, apps built with Node/.NET/Rails/Laravel, and many other things.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning t3 stack, a little more rails, more about compilers.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on interesting projects.
- 📫 How to reach me: my username + 1337 at gmail.
- 😄 Pronouns: He/him
- ⚡ Fun fact: I'm an old fart. But still feel like I'm in my 20's when I code. Started with C++ as a teenager in the mid 1990s. Turbo C++ on DOS, good times!
