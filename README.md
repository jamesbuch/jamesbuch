- 👋 Hi, I’m @jamesbuch.
- 💻 I work as a full stack developer and problem solver of difficult tasks.
- 🌐 I build a lot of Web applications.
- 🇦🇺 I live in Straya, more specifically Tamworth.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning a lot more about Laravel, Intertia and Svelte 5, all of which I really enjoy using.
- 👀 I’m interested in compilers and interpreters, arm64 machine code, apps built with Node, C# .NET Core, Laravel, Vue, Svelte, and many other things.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on interesting projects.
- 📫 How to reach me: my username + 1337 at gmail.
- ⚡ Fun fact: Started with C++ as a teenager in the mid 1990s. Turbo C++ on DOS, good times!
- ⚡ I've written working compilers that generate LLVM IR code, which I can then pass to clang to get a working program. I've also written compilers that target the JVM, using the Apache BCEL to emit the opcodes.
